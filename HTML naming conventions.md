Best practices to consider for clarity, organization, and compatibility:

- Use Lowercase Letters: Always use lowercase letters for file names. This is important because some web servers are case-sensitive. For example, about.html is preferred over About.html.
- Avoid Spaces: Do not use spaces in file names. Spaces can cause issues in URLs and can be encoded as %20, making the URL less readable. Instead of spaces, use hyphens or underscores.
- Hyphens vs. Underscores:
    - Hyphens (-): They are often used in web development for file naming and are generally preferred for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) purposes. A file name like html-intro.html is more SEO-friendly.
    - Underscores (_): They are also used but can be less visible in underlined hyperlinks. A file named html_intro.html is perfectly acceptable, though slightly less favored in SEO contexts.
- Descriptive Names: Use names that describe the content or purpose of the file. For example, contact-form.html is more descriptive than form1.html.
- Keep It Short and Simple: While being descriptive, also keep the name short and easy to remember. Avoid overly long and complex file names.
- File Extension: Ensure the file has the correct .html extension to be recognized as an HTML document.
- Version Numbers (if needed): If you are maintaining multiple versions of a file, include a version number in the file name, such as index-v2.html.
- Index.html: For the main entry point of a website (the home page), it's a common convention to name the file index.html. This is because most web servers will automatically look for a file named index.html in a directory when no specific file is specified in the URL.
- No Special Characters: Avoid using special characters like !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), +, =, {, }, [, ], |, \, ;, :, ', ", <, >, ,, ?, / in file names, as they can cause issues in URLs or with server configurations.
