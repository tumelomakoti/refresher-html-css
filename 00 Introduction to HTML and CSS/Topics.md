# Intro to HTML and CSS

## What is HTML
- Markup Language: HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a web browser. This markup is made up of various elements.
- Elements: Elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. They are represented by "tags," which are written using angle brackets. For example, <p> is a tag for a paragraph.
- Structure of a Web Page: HTML provides the structure of a webpage, not the style or dynamic behavior. It outlines where headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other content should appear on the page.
- Tags and Attributes: Most HTML elements have an opening tag (<tag>) and a closing tag (</tag>), with content in between. Attributes are used within the opening tag to provide additional information about the element, like setting a link's destination with <a href="url">.
- Hierarchy and Nesting: HTML documents have a hierarchical structure. Elements can be nested inside other elements, creating a parent-child relationship. This hierarchy is crucial for laying out a page.
- Head and Body: An HTML document is typically divided into two main parts: the head (which contains meta-information about the document, like its title) and the body (which contains the actual content of the page).
